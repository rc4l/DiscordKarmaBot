'\n`/setupserver like-reaction YOURREACTIONHERE` Sets the default 👍 reaction for the whole server. So for example if you want to use 😂, then replace `YOURREACTIONHERE` with 😂.' +
'\n`/setupchannel like-reaction YOURREACTIONHERE` Does the same as above but overrides the default like emoji just for this channel.' +
'\n`/setupserver allow-embed-reactions:Allow all` Allows like/dislike reactions for link embeds instead of just attachments for the whole server.' +
'\n`/setupchannel forbid-text:Messages must contain content` This will automatically delete messages in this channel that don\'t contain media. If you want to enforce a media-only channel this is for you.' +
